# Planned Features and Enhancements

### Major planned features

- Support for editing and creating FABulous architectures 
- Support for editing and creating user designs
- Storing only parts of the fabric in memory at a time, 
  as right now the whole fabric is held in memory at once.
  This is very restricting on the maximum size of the displayed fabric.

### Other planned features

- File explorer should reopen in the folder visited last
- More customizability (colors, ...)
- Ability to display annotated information (like coordinates) in the Fabric View
- Highlighting and selection
- Improved LOD System
- More robustness against faulty user input

### Enhancements

- Improving and adding to documentation
- Improved test coverage
- Refactoring and reduction of boilerplate code
